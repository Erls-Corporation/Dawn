Initial goal is to create a real time scraper/parser/data feed for stocks/options available on public sites such as Yahoo/Google Finance.  Will add an ant (ant.apache.org) build manifest.

First, make sure you have 'ant' installed - on Ubuntu just type 'apt-get install ant'
Then you cd into the project directory where the build.xml file is located and then:

ant compile
ant jar
ant run
